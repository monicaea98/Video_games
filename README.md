# Video Games Sales Analysis

A Python-based project for analyzing historical video games data to uncover trends in sales, platforms, genres, and user preferences across regions.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project examines a comprehensive dataset of video games, focusing on sales performance, release trends, and user/critic ratings.  
It includes data cleaning (handling missing values and data types), exploratory data analysis with visualizations (histograms, boxplots, bar charts), regional sales comparisons, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing to compare user scores across platforms and genres. The goal is to identify patterns that influence game success and support informed decisions in the gaming industry.

## 🧩 Problem it Solves
The video games market is vast and dynamic, with raw sales data often scattered and incomplete, making it hard to spot what drives popularity.  
This analysis transforms the dataset into actionable insights, revealing top-performing platforms and genres, regional differences (e.g., NA, EU, JP), and the impact of ratings—helping developers, marketers, and analysts predict trends, optimize strategies, and understand market preferences.
